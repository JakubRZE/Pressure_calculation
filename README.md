# Pressure_calculation_MatLab

The pressure distribution arising within gap between piston ring and bore surface system
was calculated using the Reynolds equation discretized by the finite difference
method. The results allow to present shapes of gap and for different piston ringâ€™s movement velocity relative to the bore
surface and pressure within gap.
